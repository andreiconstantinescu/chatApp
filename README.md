###Simple chat application 

This is a simple chat-like application that lets you post messages on a board so that other people that access the app can see the messages.

It uses `NodeJS`, `MongoDB` and `BackboneJS`. The database is hosted at `MongoHQ`. 

I developed this app as an excuse for learning how `BackboneJS` works. It is deployed [here](http://simple-chatapp.herokuapp.com).
